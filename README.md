- 👋 Hi, I’m @imacs1.  I'm a veteran computer programmer with decades of hands-on experience.  My interests are mostly math and scientific.
- 👀 I’m interested in Unreal Engine 5 for its potential as a tool (not a game).
- 🌱 I’m currently creating an add-on for the Unreal engine to do advanced point processing for commercial applications.
- 💞️ I do the "heavy lifting" backend work but have been doing Unreal Game Development for a few years.
